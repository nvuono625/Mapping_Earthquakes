# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to learn how to develop a map with cooresponding data to pinpoint specific locations. 
- At first, we mapped a single point like the city of Los Angeles, California with a radius.

- Next, we mapped multiple point, or cities, with a radius based on population size.

- Next, we mapped lines showing the route from LAX, SFO, SLC, and SEA.

- In the next 3 pictures we used GeoJSON data to learn how to plot points, linesstrings, and polygons
	- All points are major airports (Dark theme also added):

	- All line strings are departures from Toronto:

	- All polygons in this map identify each neighborhood in toronto:

- In the next 5 images, we took data about earthquakes in the past 7 days and enhanced the accessibility of the maps more each time
	- First, we made points for each earthquake:

	- Second, we changed the style of the points to orange circles:

	- Third, we changed the circle points color and size based off the magnitude of the earthquake and made it satellite view. We can also toggle information about each tag:

	- Fourth, we added a toggle to activate/deactivate the Earthquake points on the map:

	- Fifth, we added a legion in the lower right to show the color respective to the magnitude:

- In the final edition of our map, We added toggles for Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes as well as toggles for Streets, Satellite, Dark Mode, Light Mode, and Night Navigation:
